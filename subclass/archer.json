    "CharacterDescription": "Sylvie has lived all her life in the Faeborg forest, and from a very young age she had exceptional aim, even for an elf. The day the Frost Calamity descended, she was lucky, as she was training with her pet Harley at the owl sanctuary.\n\nSince then she took over the eastern owl guardian. She was losing hope when her guardian was almost depleted, but some adventurers gave her a moonstone that allowed her to recharge it.",
